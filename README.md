This is code accompanying the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08392.

Download the file "tensegrity.sage" and upload the file to your main project folder for SAGE. If you are using Cocalc the instructions are here: https://doc.cocalc.com/howto/upload.html

Then, you can load the file into your SAGE worksheet by executing the command load("tensegrity.sage"), which will load the Truss and VarTruss classes into your session, as well as some accompanying helper functions, as in the paper.

Any of the explicit code in the paper should now work in your SAGE worksheet.
